# QLD Learner Logbook approval
Every time a trip is recorded in the (QLD Learner Logbook app)[https://www.qld.gov.au/transport/licensing/getting/learner-logbook#logbookapp], an email is sent to the trip's supervisor containing a link to approve the trip.

This Google Apps Script automatically checks for these emails, loads the approval link, and submits the HTML form to approve the trip.
